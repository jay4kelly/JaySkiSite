# Alpine Skiing Site

For my Senior Capstone project I created a web site to provide skiing information about ski areas in the New England area. The site also allows users to post their own ski reviews.

## Features

- Provide list of US Eastern Ski Mountains
- Live mountain statistics for each mountain
- Ability to post and view reviews

## Technologies Utilized

- Ruby on Rails - web application framework
- Capybara - used to webscrape Google statistics to populate application
- Javascript
- HTML
- Selenium - assists in driving webscraping
